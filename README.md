# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset with thorough preprocessing and applying multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The task is a binary classification problem, where various health parameters serve as input features and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

Algorithms Implemented:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
3. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
4. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
5. Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer (Keras)

Results:
Among all models, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95%.

Dataset:
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: Heart Disease UCI Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
